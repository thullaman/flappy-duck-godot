# Flappy Duck

Flappy Duck is a 2D arcade game inspired by Flappy Bird, built using the Godot Engine. The goal of the project was to recreate a complete and polished gameplay loop from start to finish.

## Gameplay Overview
The game starts with a title screen showing the game name, a duck character, and a play button. Once the player starts the game, the duck moves continuously forward while the player controls vertical movement to pass through gaps between pillars.

Each successful pass increases the score. If the duck collides with a pillar, a sound effect is triggered and the game ends, showing a game over screen with a retry option that restarts the gameplay.

## Features
- Title screen with play button
- Continuous scrolling gameplay
- Pillar spawning with score tracking
- Collision-based game over logic
- Retry flow that resets the game state
- Background music and sound effects

## What I Learned
This project helped me understand how to:
- Structure a simple but complete game loop
- Manage game states (start, play, game over)
- Handle collisions and scoring logic
- Polish small details like UI flow and audio feedback

## Tools & Tech
- Engine: Godot
- Language: GDScript
